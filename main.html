<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. An efficient algorithm is one that minimizes this time complexity.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the space used grows linearly with the input size.</p>

</body>
</html>
Explanation:
The <h1> tag contains all three required keywords.
The first paragraph discusses Time Complexity and includes the required keywords.
The second paragraph discusses Space Complexity, includes the required keywords, and uses the <b> tag to bold “Space Complexity.”
Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!

is this answer is correct or wrong

AM
Let’s analyze your HTML code against the requirements:

<h1> Element:

Your <h1> tag is correct: <h1>Time, Space, Complexity,</h1>
However, the trailing comma is unnecessary.
First <p> Element:

Your first paragraph: <p>Time complexity,and efficient.'</p>
Issues:
There is no space after “complexity,” and before “and.”
The phrase “efficient” should be included in a complete sentence. It seems incomplete.
Second <p> Element:

Your second paragraph: <p>'Space Complexity' 'O(n)'</p>
Issues:
The single quotes around “Space Complexity” and “O(n)” are unnecessary and make it look awkward.
It lacks context and should be a complete sentence explaining Space Complexity.
Bold Text:

You have a separate <P>Space Complexity</P> which is not needed. Instead, “Space Complexity” should be bolded within the second paragraph.
Overall Structure:

The overall structure is there, but the content needs to be more coherent and complete.
Corrected Version:
Here’s how you could revise your HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. An efficient algorithm minimizes this time complexity.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the space used grows linearly with the input size.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
