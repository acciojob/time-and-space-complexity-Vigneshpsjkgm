  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Analyzing time complexity helps us design more efficient</p> 

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with input size. Understanding is essential for building memory-efficient solutions.</p>
